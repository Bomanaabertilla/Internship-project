        <h1>Basic parts of a computer.</h1>
        <p> The computer comprises of many parts.<br>
            
            <ul>
                <li><h2><b>MONITOR</b></h2><p>
                    A monitor is a device that outputs visual information from a computer or other electronic device.<br> 
                    Monitors are commonly used as the primary output interface for computers, allowing users to interact with the system through a graphical user interface (GUI). <br>
                     They can also be used with other devices like gaming consoles, media players, and cameras.

                <li><h2><b>KEYBOARD</b></h2><p>
                    A keyboard is an input device used to type texts, numbers, and symbols into a computer or other electronic device. <br>
                    It consists of a set of keys that, when pressed, send signals to the device to produce corresponding characters or perform specific actions.
                </p>
                <p> There are types of keyboards which include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Mechanical Keyboard</b>
                        <p>
                        A mechanical keyboard is a type of keyboard that uses individual mechanical switches for each key, rather than the rubber dome or membrane switches commonly found in standard keyboards.<br>
                         Each mechanical switch consists of a spring-loaded mechanism with moving parts, which provides a distinct tactile feedback and audible click when pressed, depending on the type of switch.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Wireless Keyboard</b>
                        <p>
                            A wireless keyboard is a type of keyboard that connects to a computer, tablet, or other device without the use of physical cables. <br>
                            Instead, it communicates with the device using wireless technologies such as Bluetooth, radio frequency (RF), or infrared (IR). <br>
                            Wireless keyboards offer greater flexibility and mobility, as they eliminate the need for wires, making them ideal for both home and office environments.

                    <li><b>Ergonomic Keyboard</b>
                        <p>
                            An ergonomic keyboard is a type of keyboard designed to minimize strain on the hands, wrists, and arms during typing, reducing the risk of repetitive strain injuries (RSIs) like carpal tunnel syndrome.<br>
                             These keyboards are often shaped and arranged to promote a more natural hand position, improving comfort and efficiency for long periods of typing.

                </ul>
                
                </li>
                <br>

                <p></p>

                <li><h2><b>MOUSE</b></h2><p>
                    A mouse is a pointing device used to interact with a computer's graphical user interface (GUI). <br>
                    It allows users to move a cursor on the screen and perform various actions such as selecting, dragging, clicking, and scrolling. <br>
                    The mouse is an essential tool for navigating and interacting with software, making it easier to access and control computer functions.<br>
                   <p> There are types of mice which include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Optical Mouse</b>
                            <p>
                                An optical mouse is a type of computer mouse that uses a light source, typically an LED (light-emitting diode), and a sensor to detect movement.<br>
                                 Unlike traditional mechanical mice that use a rolling ball to track motion, an optical mouse relies on changes in reflected light to track movement across a surface. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <img src="optimal.jpg" alt="optimal">

                        <li><b>Laser Mouse</b>
                            <p>
                                A laser mouse is a type of computer mouse that uses a laser instead of an LED to detect movement. <br>
                                The key difference between a laser mouse and an optical mouse is the type of light source used and the level of precision it offers.<br>
                                 Laser mice are generally more accurate and can work on a wider variety of surfaces compared to traditional optical mice.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Trackball Mouse</b>
                            <p>
                                A trackball mouse is a type of computer input device that uses a ball housed within a stationary unit to control the movement of the cursor on the screen.<br>
                                 Unlike traditional mice, which are moved across a surface to control the cursor, a trackball mouse remains stationary while the user manipulates the ball to control movement.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Gaming Mouse</b>
                            <p>
                                A gaming mouse is a specialized computer mouse designed to enhance the gaming experience by offering features that improve precision, speed, and customization. <br>
                                These mice are built with gamers in mind and come with various enhancements that make them more suitable for the demands of gaming compared to standard mice.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Ergonomic Mouse</b>
                            <p>
                                An ergonomic mouse is a type of computer mouse designed to reduce strain and discomfort associated with prolonged computer use.<br>
                                 Its primary goal is to promote a more natural hand position and minimize the risk of repetitive strain injuries (RSIs) such as carpal tunnel syndrome. <br>
                                Ergonomic mice often feature designs that align with the natural posture of the hand and wrist to improve comfort and reduce physical stress.
