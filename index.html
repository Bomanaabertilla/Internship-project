        <h2>What is a Computer?</h2>
        <p>A computer is an electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data.<br>
             It helps us with many tasks like playing games, doing homework, drawing pictures, and connecting with friends and family.<br> 
            Computers are all around us and make our lives easier.</p>
